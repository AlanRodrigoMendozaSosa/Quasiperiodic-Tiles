Folder with the .csv files corresponding to the nearest neighbour distance distribution for different quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N. These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Dynamics and structure of quasicrystals: an efficient algorithm to simulate quasiperiodic environments" available in
