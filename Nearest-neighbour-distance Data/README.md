The .csv files corresponding to the nearest neighbour distance distribution for different quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N are located in a public Drive folder due to their size, this folder can be consulted through this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cHO_wGJ6glPutnybj6upCFwAAXztsw4Y?usp=sharing

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Dynamics and structure of quasicrystals: an efficient algorithm to simulate quasiperiodic environments" available in

It should be noted that the version of the code that generated these files collects the information of the first, second and third nearest neighbors according to the Voronoi cell definition, so the generated .csv files contain these three distances.
