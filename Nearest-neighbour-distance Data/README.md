Each of the .csv files contained in this folder correspond to the distances to the nearest neighbor of a set of 1x10^6 sites of the quasiperiodic lattice of rotational symmetry N.

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Structural studies of local environments in high-symmetry quasicrystals" available at...

It should be noted that the version of the code that generated these data collects the information of the first, second and third nearest neighbor according to the definition of the Voronoi cell, however, in the article of interest only the data corresponding to the nearest neighbor is used, reason for which only these data are presented.
