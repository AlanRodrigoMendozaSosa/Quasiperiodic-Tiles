Each of the .csv files contained in this folder correspond to the Nearest Neighbor Distance Distribution for a set of 2x10^6 sites of the rotationally symmetric quasiperiodic lattice N = 307.
Each set corresponds to different values ​​of the parameter "alpha " related to the isomorphism classes of the system.

The file nomenclature indicates the rotational symmetry of the system ("N307") as well as the value of the corresponding Xi parameter. For example:

Xi0P3 corresponds to Xi = 0.3
