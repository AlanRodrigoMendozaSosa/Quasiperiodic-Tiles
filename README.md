# Quasiperiodic-Tiles
An algorithm based in the Generalized Dual Method to create quasiperiodic tiles of arbitrary symmetry centered in an arbitrary point in a 2D space

I would like to thank Atahualpa S. Kraemer (@ata0k) for the discussions and ideas that led to several of the functions implemented in this algorithm, to Enrique GÃ³mez Cruz (@couscouscricket) for their excellent job behind the Voronoi's polygons algorithm used in this algorithm (and all the aditions to their code that he implemented to make my work easier) and, in general, to the work's group around Atahualpa whose always been there to help with his comments and their ideas in the generation of this algorithm.
