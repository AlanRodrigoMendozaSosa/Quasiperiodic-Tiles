# Quasiperiodic-Tiles
An algorithm based in the Generalized Dual Method to create quasiperiodic lattices of arbitrary symmetry around an arbitrary point in a 2D space.

I would like to thank Enrique GÃ³mez Cruz (@couscouscricket) for their excellent job behind the Voronoi's polygons algorithm used in this algorithm (and all the aditions to their code that he implemented to make my work easier) and, in general, to the work's group around Atahualpa whose always been there to help with his comments and their ideas in the generation of this algorithm.
