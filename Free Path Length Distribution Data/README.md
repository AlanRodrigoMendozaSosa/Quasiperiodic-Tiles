Folder with the .csv files corresponding to the free path lengths of a particle in a Quasiperiodic Lorentz gas at the Boltzmann-Grad limit. These data were used to generate the graphs present in the paper "Efficient algorithm for simulating particles in true quasiperiodic environments" available at https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac6b68/meta
