Each of the .csv files contained in this folder correspond to the Voronoi areas associated with the Voronoi cells of a set of 1x10^6 sites of the N rotational symmetry quasiperiodic lattice.

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Structural studies of local environments in high-symmetry quasicrystals" available at...
