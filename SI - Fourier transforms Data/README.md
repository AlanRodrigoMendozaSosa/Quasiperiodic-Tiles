Each of the .csv files contained in this folder correspond to the values ​​of the Fourier transform associated with a set of square patch sites of a quasiperiodic lattice of rotational symmetry N.

The file nomenclature indicates the value of the rotational symmetry N (for example, "N7" for a rotational symmetry N = 7), the radius of the local neighborhood of the quasiperiodic array in which the square patch is inscribed (for example, "R400" for a square patch inscribed in a circular neighborhood of radius R = 400)

The files contain three columns X,Y,Z. The values of X and Y give the kx = (2pi/Lx)*nx  and ky = (2pi/Ly)*ny values, where nx and ny are integers running from -nmax to nmax. The nmax parameter is provided in the filename and corresponds to a number that was chosen arbitrarily. Lx = Ly is the length of the box. The third column gives the Fourier transformed values at kx and ky.
