The files contained in this folder correspond to the functions used to compute the Voronoi area distribution in quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N.

The "Voronois_Areas_Lattice_Sites_Distribution.ipynb" notebook contains the main lines of code to run the simulation, the values particulars of the variables contained in it correspond to the case of rotational symmetry N = 5.
