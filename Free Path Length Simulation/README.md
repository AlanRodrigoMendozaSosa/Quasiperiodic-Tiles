The files contained in this folder correspond to the functions used to simulate a particle in a Quasiperiodic Lorentz gas at the Boltzmann-Grad limit. Notebook "Free_Flights_Trajectory_N_13.ipynb" contains the main lines of code to run the simulation, the particular values of the variables contained in it correspond to the case of rotational symmetry N = 13.
