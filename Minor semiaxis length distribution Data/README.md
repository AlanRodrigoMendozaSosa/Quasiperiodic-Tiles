The .csv files contained in this folder corresponds to the length of the semi-minor axis of a set of 1x10^6 tiles of a quasiperiodic arrangement of rotational symmetry N = 1009. The total data was separated into 5 different files for memory reasons.

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Structural studies of local environments in high-symmetry quasicrystals" available at...
