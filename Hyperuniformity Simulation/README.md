The files contained in this folder correspond to the functions used to compute the function N_{s}(r) in quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N.

The "N(R)_N5.ipynb" notebook contains the main lines of code to run the simulation, the values particulars of the variables contained in it correspond to the case of rotational symmetry N = 5.
