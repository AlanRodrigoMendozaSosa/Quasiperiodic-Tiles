In this notebook we implement a slight modification to the algorithm that generate the Neighborhood of the Quasiperiodic Lattice around an arbitrary point in the space.

This modification only consider the polygons within a circle of a given radius around that arbitrary point.
That makes the final Neihgborhood smaller, making the algorithm to find the container polygon faster.

Consider that, for some applications, we would prefer a bigger neighborhood, so in the final program this function could not be included.

Also, we implement here again the algorithm that find the container polygon.
