In this notebook we show how to obtain an average radius for the main cluster of one neighborhood of the quasiperiodic lattice around an arbitrary point.

This average radius depends of the characteristics of the generated neighborhoods, so it must be calculated every time the parameters of the neighborhoods with which it will work are modified.
