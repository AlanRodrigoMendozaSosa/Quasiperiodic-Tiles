In this notebook we show how to get the main cluster of a neighborhood of the quasiperiodic lattice around an arbitrary point using an algorithm based in the areas of the Voronoi's polygons generated by the set of the polygon's centroids of the neighborhood.

It's more efficient than the algorithm showed in the "Main_Cluster's_Polygons_(Brute_Force)".
