In this notebook an algorithm to obtain the maximum radius of the obstacles in the Quasiperiodic Array such the obstacles are totally inside of their container Voronoi's Polygon is showed.
This is important because that "Safe Obstacle Radius" is a maximum value for an Obstacle Radius in order to use the efficient algorithm to obtain the MSD showed in the folder "MSD_Various_Point"
