In this notebook we show how to use the Voronoi's algorithm programmed by Enrique GÃ³mez Cruz (@couscouscricket) to find the container polygon of a Quasiperiodic Lattice of a arbitrary point in the space.

The version of Voronoi's algorithm used in this notebook correspond to the version available at 2-December-2019 in the Enrique's Github.
