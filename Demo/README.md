In this folder we can find some subfolders with notebooks and the files required by them to run. In those notebooks several examples of what can be done with the programmed algorithms are presented.

### Order of lecture.
A recommended order of lecture (based in how the code was developed) is:

1.- Quasiperiodic_Lattice_GDM

2.- Quasiperiodic_Stripe

3.- Quasiperiodic_Neighborhood_Arbitrary_Point

4.- Container_Polygon

5.- Bounded_Neighborhood

6.- Container_Polygon_(Voronoi's_Algorithm)

7.- Efficiency_Test_for_Three_Containers_Polygon's_Algorithm

8.- Main_Cluster's_Polygons_(Brute_Force)

9.- Areas_Distribution_Main_Cluster_(Arbitrary_Symmetry)

10.- Main_Cluster's_Polygons_(Areas_Algorithm)

11.- Number_of_Edges_Distribution_(Main_Cluster)_(Voronoi's_Polygons)

12.- Main_Cluster_Size

13.- Square_Main_Cluster


**Note: The next folders will be updated soon as a new Voronoi algorithm developed by Enrique was released.**

5.- Main_Cluster's_Polygons_(Areas_Algorithm)

6.- Number_of_Edges_Distribution_(Main_Cluster)_(Voronoi's_Polygons)

7.- Main_Cluster_Size

8.- Square_Main_Cluster
