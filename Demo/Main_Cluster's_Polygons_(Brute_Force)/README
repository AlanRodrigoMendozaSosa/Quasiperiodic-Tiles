In this notebook we show how to obtain by Brute Force the Main Cluster of polygons in a neighborhood of a Quasiperiodic Lattice generated around an arbitrary point.

This method was useful because it let us to know an statistical distribution of the areas of the polygons in the main cluster.

That information let us generate a more intelligent algorithm to obtain the main cluster of a set of polygons.
