The files contained in this folder correspond to the functions used to compute the nearest neighbor distance distribution in quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N. The "Free_Flights_Trajectory_N_13.ipynb" notebook contains the main lines of code to run the simulation, the values particulars of the variables contained in it correspond to the case of rotational symmetry N = 13.
