The files contained in this folder correspond to the functions used to compute the nearest neighbor distance distribution in quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N. 

The "Nearest Neighbor Distance Distribution.ipynb" notebook contains the main lines of code to run the simulation, the values particulars of the variables contained in it correspond to the case of rotational symmetry N = 5.

It should be noted that this version of the code collects the information of the first, second and third nearest neighbors according to the Voronoi cell definition, so the generated .csv files contain these three distances.
