The .csv files corresponding to the Hyperuniformity analysis for different quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N are located in a public Drive folder due to their size, this folder can be consulted through this link:

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Dynamics and structure of quasicrystals: an efficient algorithm to simulate quasiperiodic environments" available in
