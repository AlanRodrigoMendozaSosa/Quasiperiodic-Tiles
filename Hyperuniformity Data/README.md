The .csv files corresponding to the Hyperuniformity analysis for different quasiperiodic lattices of rotational symmetry N are located in a public Drive folder due to their size, this folder can be consulted through this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q6rZ0V5dz6TxF7JDCq_47e2vs7EJtAcT?usp=sharing

These data were used to generate the graphs present in the article "Efficient algorithm enables structural studies of high-symmetry quasicrystals" available at
